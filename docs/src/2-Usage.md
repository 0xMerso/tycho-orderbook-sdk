# Usage

This section explains how to integrate and use the **Tycho-Orderbook** crate in your project.

## 1. Adding the Dependency

ðŸ”º The crate is not yet published !

To use the tycho-orderbook crate, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tycho-orderbook = "0.1.0"
```

## 2. Instanciate the provider

The OrderbookBuilder structure is used to build a Tycho ProtocolStreamBuilder, which creates a data and event stream for the specified network.
The ProtocolStreamBuilder takes into account numerous configuration parameters, such as supported exchanges (Uniswap, Curve, etc.) and pool filters (minimum TVL).
    
    let builder = OrderbookBuilder::new(network.clone(), env.clone(), builder_config.clone(), Some(tokens.clone())).await;

The OrderbookProvider structure is the crate's main component. It listens to Tycho streams, and opens a stream on which the client will listen for new events.
Each time a new event is emitted, you'll know which states have changed, i.e. which liquidity pools have evolved, and you can trigger the recalculation of the orderbook.

The OrderbookProvider has a shared memory state which is used to internally update data that includes liquidity pool (= component) data.
More importantly, this Arc Mutex structure contains pointers to the simulation functions provided by Tycho for each component, used to compute the orderbooks.

    match builder.build(provider_config.clone(), xstate.clone()).await

## 3. Compute an orderbook

An orderbook is characterized by a tag, which is the address of base token, a dash '-', and the address of the quote token.
For instance, for BTC-USDC on ethereum, it would be:    

    0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599-0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48

To create an orderbook and obtain its formalized bids/asks, using OrderbookProvider, you need to do:

    obp.get_orderbook(OrderbookRequestParams { tag: tag.clone(), sps: None }, Some(simufns)).await
    let depth = newob.depth(None);    

The *sps* structure for SinglePointSimulation can be filled in to simulate a single trade, a degree of depth in the orderbook in fact.
